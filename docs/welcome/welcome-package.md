# Welcome Package: SYNAPSE Spark of Rebellion

Welcome, Rebel! You are now part of a community built on trust, transparency, and Hopepunk resilience.

## Our Commitment to a Fair Game
All community choices are recorded on the Trustless Narrative Ledger (TNL)â€”an immutable, transparent system ensuring your voice is never erased or manipulated. Every vote, every story, every contribution is part of our shared legacy.

## Getting Started
1. **Join our Discord**
   - Use your backer email to request the "Verified Backer" role.
   - This links your pledge to your community identity and unlocks exclusive channels.
2. **Access Your Rewards**
   - Check your email for digital assets and instructions.
   - Higher tiers: follow instructions to access lore vault, submit story suggestions, or activate Validator Node privileges.
3. **Participate in the Narrative**
   - Watch for story votes and feedback cycles announced on Discord and the TNL portal.
   - Your choices shape the canon!

## Hopepunk Philosophy
We believe in stories that build, not break. Your participation helps us create a world where hope is a rebellion.
